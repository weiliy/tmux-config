# tmux-config
my tmux config and notes

## Init

The config is base on [Making tmux Pretty and Usable - A Guide to Customizing your tmux.conf](http://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-guide-to-customizing-your-tmux-conf/), and add the powerline for better look.

[Add power to your terminal with powerline](https://fedoramagazine.org/add-power-terminal-powerline/)


## Issue

### Meta(Alt) not work

I used the terminator as the default terminal app, but it seem that not work with Meta key. I only can press Win and Alt at same time. My solution is replace the terminator with gnome-terminal, as the tmux already have most function of terminator.
